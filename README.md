# ember-abandon-decorators-codemod


A codemod to migrate away from 1.x Ember Decorators. Thanks to @rwjblue for [`codemod-cli`](https://github.com/rwjblue/codemod-cli) and @simonihmig for [`ember-test-helpers-codemod`](https://github.com/simonihmig/ember-test-helpers-codemod), which I looked to for guidance in this mysterious world of AST transforms.

This is set up to migrate [`travis-web`](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-web), so itâ€™s not universally-applicable. For instance, the codebase only uses four unary computed property macros: `alias`, `empty`, `not`, and `reads`, so if you use `bool`, it would skip that. It wouldnâ€™t be hard to include others, so let me know if that would be useful for you!

This deletes whitespace that I donâ€™t want deleted, at the momentâ€¦ ðŸ˜¢
